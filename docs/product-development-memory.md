# Product Development Memory

Last updated: 2026-07-15

## Purpose

This file is the durable project memory for product-development work. It is meant for Fernando, Codex sessions, and future AI agents working together on the same repo.

The short version: this is not only a visual furniture builder. It is already a local-first furniture design platform with the beginnings of SaaS behavior: users, cloud projects, publishing, demos, and remixable public examples.

## Current Product Direction

- Spanish-first interface for current users and product exploration.
- Keep enough English/internal state to allow future scaling and localization.
- Move the product away from "technical prototype" aesthetics toward a calm, premium furniture/product feel.
- Build toward ready-to-use examples/templates: public demo projects that users can view and remix into editable local projects.
- Prioritize fixes and product workflow quality before a larger rebrand/commercial packaging phase.

## Discovered Platform Capabilities

The codebase already includes:

- Passwordless email auth via OTP.
- Session cookie auth.
- Email verification state.
- User table with `is_admin`.
- Local projects in IndexedDB.
- Yjs snapshots for project state.
- Optional cloud records backed by Postgres.
- Public project pages at `/p/:id`.
- Publish/unpublish flow.
- Demo projects via `projects.is_demo`.
- Remix flow from public project to editable local copy.
- `remix_count` tracking.
- Admin-only demo toggling.
- AI furniture generation endpoints and UI surfaces.

This means the product has a real platform foundation, not just a local visual editor.

## Demo / Ready-To-Use Flow

A project appears in the home "Demos" section only when all are true:

- `is_demo = true`
- `visibility = 'public'`
- `snapshot IS NOT NULL`
- `deleted_at IS NULL`

When a user opens a demo card:

- The card links to `/p/:id`, the public viewer.
- The user cannot edit the original demo.
- Pressing "Remix" imports the public Yjs document as a new local editable project named like `Name (remix)`.
- If the user is anonymous, Remix opens auth first and continues after login.
- Remix count is incremented best-effort through `/api/public/projects/:id/remix`.

Admin workflow to create a demo:

1. Create or open the source project.
2. Publish it so the cloud record becomes public and has a snapshot.
3. Use the project/card menu and choose "Marcar como demo".
4. Check the home Demos section.

Current local caveat: `LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS=true` returns `local@localhost`, but this bypass user currently has `is_admin: false`. For local product work, consider making the dev bypass admin or using a real DB user with `is_admin = true`.

## Recent Product/UI Work

Important recent changes in this working tree:

- UI copy moved substantially to Spanish while retaining English copy state.
- Project tabs ordered as `Diseño`, `Estilo`, `Corte`.
- Style controls moved into the same left sidebar pattern as design.
- Removed redundant style mode selector from the style sidebar because mode exists in the visual preview controls.
- Sidebar/editor width behavior received several alignment and resize fixes.
- Design detail row now includes compact editable Fondo/Grosor/Vuelo controls in cm.
- `Vuelo` became a `no/sí` toggle:
  - `no` sets overhang to 0 and aligns columns flush.
  - `sí` restores a positive overhang/default.
- Fixed assembly/render mismatch when `Vuelo no` was used.
- Defaults moved away from debug blue/green/yellow panels.
- New palette direction:
  - App light mode: soft gray, white surfaces, graphite text.
  - Accent: restrained white-oak/brass, not technical orange.
  - 3D rendered defaults: white lacquer body and soft gray fronts.
  - Added material presets for soft gray lacquer and graphite lacquer.
- Product pill v1 added to the project canvas:
  - Collapsed product entry point with inline expansion.
  - Theme switch, ES/EN locale switch, restart project, and home action.
  - Restart clears the furniture document while preserving project identity.
  - Locale preference persists in `tenon-locale`; theme preference persists through the existing color-mode storage.
  - Current known polish items are non-blocking: closing animation, re-click behavior on the collapsed mark, and focus restoration after Escape.

Current status of handles/pulls:

- Physical pomos/tiradores v1 are implemented in the 3D assembly render.
- Drawers render a short horizontal graphite pull using the existing pair of pull-hole positions as supports.
- Single-door fronts render a small graphite knob at the existing pull-hole position.
- The 2D editor/preview now uses the same visual language: drawer bars and door knobs instead of generic hole dots.
- Diseño now controls handles per selected front module: enabled/disabled, upper/center/lower position, and horizontal/vertical orientation.
- Estilo presents `Tiradores` as a fifth product part alongside body, sides, shelves, and fronts. Its picker combines the global visual type (`Automático`, `Pomo`, `Barra`) and finish (`Grafito`, `Níquel`, `Latón`) in one consistent part-selection pattern.
- Existing projects normalize to handles enabled, upper placement, contextual orientation, and `Automático · Grafito`, preserving the previous appearance.
- Disabling handles removes their pull-hole operations from compiled geometry and cutlist output.
- Type and finish variants remain visual in v1; model-specific drilling patterns and purchasable hardware specifications are a future manufacturing step.

## Current Suggested Roadmap

Near-term order:

1. Keep stable product milestones committed and pushed when they close a coherent block.
2. Validate the Apple-like palette visually in real projects and demos.
3. Make local dev admin workflow comfortable.
4. Create/curate a first set of ready-to-use demo projects.
5. Add visual realism:
   - Pomos/tiradores first.
   - Simple feet next.
   - Wheels later as a separate product choice.

Product reasoning:

- Palette changes improve perception quickly with lower geometry risk.
- Handles/pulls add realism and are already adjacent to existing drawer/door logic.
- Simple feet are broadly useful and premium; wheels are more specific and should be optional later.

## Collaboration Notes

- Fernando does hands-on browser testing and gives visual/product feedback quickly.
- Keep explanations direct and in Spanish unless there is a reason to switch.
- Do not over-engineer when the request is a visual/product move.
- Prefer the existing component architecture and domain helpers.
- Preserve good editor "movement" and resizing behavior; recent regressions happened when layout constraints were too rigid.
- When updating visual UI, test/verify in browser when possible, and keep the dev server on `127.0.0.1:3003`.

## Git / Repo Notes

- Current active branch during recent work: `codex/spanish-ui-i18n`.
- Local remote `origin` points to `https://github.com/boldtonic/tenon.git`.
- The GitHub repo may still be marked as a fork, but local `upstream` was removed earlier.
- Some `docs/superpowers/` files are tracked for the product pill spec/plan. Avoid unrelated superpowers docs unless explicitly requested.
- `.claude/` is local tool configuration and should not be committed unless Fernando explicitly asks for it.
- Worktree may be dirty; never revert user or unrelated changes.

## Open Product Questions

- Should home label "Demos" become "Ejemplos", "Plantillas", or "Inspiración"?
- Should demo cards have a direct "Usar plantilla" action instead of only opening the public viewer?
- Should local auth bypass be admin in dev by default?
- What first demo set best communicates the product: TV unit, bookshelf, wardrobe, low console, modular shelf?
- How much of the future SaaS/org plan should be implemented now versus kept as architecture notes?
